        This article talks about the benefits and risks of digitized DNA like it can make it easy for police officers to make arrests, pharmacists to approximate medical needs, and researchers to make new inventions and studies. However, this data can easily be exploited by hackers and no risk is not guaranteed for anybody once the data is digitized.

        <th width="25%">What's being digitized?</th>
        <th width="25%"> What was the goal or purpose of digitalizing this thing? </th> 
          <tr>
            <td>DNA is being digitized where our personal medical data is recorded. Anything that can be determined through our DNA can be shown in this data. </td>
            <td> DNA is being digitized because it becomes useful to researchers who want to create new inventions, police officers who can match their database to this to find criminals, and insurance companies use it to approximate medical needs.</td>

        <th width=25%>Is someone benefiting from this situation? If so, who?</th>
        <th width=25%> Is someone being harmed in this situation? If so, who?</th>
          <tr>
            <td>
              Yes, we are the ones benefitting from this situation becuase this recorded data can be helpful towards creating inventions that play in our favor. 
            </td>
            <td>
             Yes, we are also the ones being harmed in this situation becuase the recorded data can be an easy target to hackers who want to use that data for blackmail.

      <th width=25%>How do you know? </th>
      <tr>
        <td>
          These impacts are unintended. 
        </td>
        <td>
          I know this becuase we can't ever be sure our information is fully protected once it is digtized becuase that is the main objective of hackers. 
        </td>
