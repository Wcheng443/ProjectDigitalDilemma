<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; ;font-size:15px;">
  Using CGI to “revive” actors is a very controversial topic. 
  <br>
  This article begs the question of whether using CGI to “revive” deceased actors is ethical or not. On one hand, the actor cannot physically give consent to be a part of said movie/show and it’s overall a little odd and creepy to see someone who no longer exists on this planet act in a movie after their death. However, others see it in the way that it can honor the actor and that as long as the family consent to the action, it is perfectly okay. This is honestly a matter of personal beliefs and opinions but really shows just how far computer science has come.

        <td>These impacts are unintended. I know this because there is no reason for the directors to want a negative impact on their own work, as it was bring down the value of the film.</td>
